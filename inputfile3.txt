Apache Spark is an open-source cluster computing framework originally developed in the AMPLab at UC Berkeley. In contrast to Hadoop's two-stage disk-based MapReduce paradigm, Spark's in-memory primitives provide performance up to 100 times faster for certain applications.[1] By allowing user programs to load data into a cluster's memory and query it repeatedly, Spark is well suited to machine learning algorithms.[2]

Spark requires a cluster manager and a distributed storage system. For cluster management, Spark supports standalone (native Spark cluster), Hadoop YARN, or Apache Mesos.[3] For distributed storage, Spark can interface with a wide variety, including Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS),[4] Cassandra,[5] OpenStack Swift, and Amazon S3. Spark also supports a pseudo-distributed local mode, usually used only for development or testing purposes, where distributed storage is not required and the local file system can be used instead; in this scenario, Spark is running on a single machine with one executor per CPU core.

Spark had over 465 contributors in 2014,[6] making it the most active project in the Apache Software Foundation and among Big Data open source projects.

In contrast to Hadoop's two-stage disk-based MapReduce paradigm, Spark's in-memory primitives provide performance up to 100 times faster for certain applications.[1] By allowing user programs to load data into a cluster's memory and query it repeatedly, Spark is well suited to machine learning algorithms.[2]

Spark requires a cluster manager and a distributed storage system. For cluster management, Spark supports standalone (native Spark cluster), Hadoop YARN, or Apache Mesos.[3] For distributed storage, Spark can interface with a wide variety, including Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS),[4] Cassandra,[5] OpenStack Swift, and Amazon S3. Spark also supports a pseudo-distributed local mode, usually used only for development or testing purposes, where distributed storage is not required and the local file system can be used instead; in this scenario, Spark is running on a single machine with one executor per CPU core.

Spark requires a cluster manager and a distributed storage system. For cluster management, Spark supports standalone (native Spark cluster), Hadoop YARN, or Apache Mesos.[3] For distributed storage, Spark can interface with a wide variety, including Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS),[4] Cassandra,[5] OpenStack Swift, and Amazon S3. Spark also supports a pseudo-distributed local mode, usually used only for development or testing purposes, where distributed storage is not required and the local file system can be used instead; in this scenario, Spark is running on a single machine with one executor per CPU core.

Spark had over 465 contributors in 2014,[6] making it the most active project in the Apache Software Foundation and among Big Data open source projects.

Apache Spark is an open-source cluster computing framework originally developed in the AMPLab at UC Berkeley. In contrast to Hadoop's two-stage disk-based MapReduce paradigm, Spark's in-memory primitives provide performance up to 100 times faster for certain applications.[1] By allowing user programs to load data into a cluster's memory and query it repeatedly, Spark is well suited to machine learning algorithms.[2]

Spark had over 465 contributors in 2014,[6] making it the most active project in the Apache Software Foundation and among Big Data open source projects.

Apache Spark is an open-source cluster computing framework originally developed in the AMPLab at UC Berkeley. In contrast to Hadoop's two-stage disk-based MapReduce paradigm, Spark's in-memory primitives provide performance up to 100 times faster for certain applications.[1] By allowing user programs to load data into a cluster's memory and query it repeatedly, Spark is well suited to machine learning algorithms.[2]

Spark had over 465 contributors in 2014,[6] making it the most active project in the Apache Software Foundation and among Big Data open source projects.

Apache Spark is an open-source cluster computing framework originally developed in the AMPLab at UC Berkeley. In contrast to Hadoop's two-stage disk-based MapReduce paradigm, Spark's in-memory primitives provide performance up to 100 times faster for certain applications.[1] By allowing user programs to load data into a cluster's memory and query it repeatedly, Spark is well suited to machine learning algorithms.[2]

Spark had over 465 contributors in 2014,[6] making it the most active project in the Apache Software Foundation and among Big Data open source projects.Apache Spark is an open-source cluster computing framework originally developed in the AMPLab at UC Berkeley. In contrast to Hadoop's two-stage disk-based MapReduce paradigm, Spark's in-memory primitives provide performance up to 100 times faster for certain applications.[1] By allowing user programs to load data into a cluster's memory and query it repeatedly, Spark is well suited to machine learning algorithms.[2]

Spark had over 465 contributors in 2014,[6] making it the most active project in the Apache Software Foundation and among Big Data open source projects.

Apache Spark is an open-source cluster computing framework originally developed in the AMPLab at UC Berkeley. In contrast to Hadoop's two-stage disk-based MapReduce paradigm, Spark's in-memory primitives provide performance up to 100 times faster for certain applications.[1] By allowing user programs to load data into a cluster's memory and query it repeatedly, Spark is well suited to machine learning algorithms.[2]

Spark had over 465 contributors in 2014,[6] making it the most active project in the Apache Software Foundation and among Big Data open source projects.

Apache Spark is an open-source cluster computing framework originally developed in the AMPLab at UC Berkeley. In contrast to Hadoop's two-stage disk-based MapReduce paradigm, Spark's in-memory primitives provide performance up to 100 times faster for certain applications.[1] By allowing user programs to load data into a cluster's memory and query it repeatedly, Spark is well suited to machine learning algorithms.[2]

Spark had over 465 contributors in 2014,[6] making it the most active project in the Apache Software Foundation and among Big Data open source projects.

Apache Spark is an open-source cluster computing framework originally developed in the AMPLab at UC Berkeley. In contrast to Hadoop's two-stage disk-based MapReduce paradigm, Spark's in-memory primitives provide performance up to 100 times faster for certain applications.[1] By allowing user programs to load data into a cluster's memory and query it repeatedly, Spark is well suited to machine learning algorithms.[2]

For cluster management, Spark supports standalone (native Spark cluster), Hadoop YARN, or Apache Mesos.[3] For distributed storage, Spark can interface with a wide variety, including Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS),[4] Cassandra,[5] OpenStack Swift, and Amazon S3. Spark also supports a pseudo-distributed local mode, usually used only for development or testing purposes, where distributed storage is not required and the local file system can be used instead; in this scenario, Spark is running on a single machine with one executor per CPU core.

Spark had over 465 contributors in 2014,[6] making it the most active project in the Apache Software Foundation and among Big Data open source projects.Apache Spark is an open-source cluster computing framework originally developed in the AMPLab at UC Berkeley. In contrast to Hadoop's two-stage disk-based MapReduce paradigm, Spark's in-memory primitives provide performance up to 100 times faster for certain applications.[1] By allowing user programs to load data into a cluster's memory and query it repeatedly, Spark is well suited to machine learning algorithms.[2]
